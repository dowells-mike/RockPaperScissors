# RockPaperScissors
A java-based Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against the computer

--Detailed Description--
This is a basic implementation of a rock paper scissors game against the computer. The game is played in rounds, and the player and computer take turns making moves. The player's and computer's scores are kept track of, and the game ends when one of them reaches the number of rounds specified by NUM_ROUNDS. The winner is determined based on the rules of rock paper scissors, and the final score is displayed to the player. You can expand upon this implementation by adding additional features, such as a timer or additional moves, if desired.
